### Project Ideas
- Nested: 
#### Inspiration
27 million people move to cities every year in the US, and moving is listed as one of the top 5 most stressful life events according to verywellmind.com.

Each of our team members has moved in the past year, and we all felt overwhelmed as we not only had to move our stuff, but also move our habits and routines. We had to answer the questions: where should I buy groceries, where will I get my haircut, what doctor should we see, and more? And it would take a few months to find these answers, often requiring asking friends for advice, and spending hours on forums and navigation tools.

We wondered, is there a more efficient way to discover the nest of places that will make up our lives in a new city?

#### What it does
So we built Nested. Nested helps you move to a new city with ease by matching you with places based on your lifestyle. It analyzes your google maps search history to understand your preferences, and then provides tailored suggestions to nearby grocery stories, gyms, museums, or any type of place you can think of!

#### Technologies Used
Frontend: React, TypeScript, Material UI
Backend: Flask, Python
APIs: Google Places API, Distance Matrix API, Geocoding API, Identity Toolkit API, Maps Javascript API, Generative Language API, Token Service API, Google Drive API, & People API
